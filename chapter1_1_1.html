  <h1>1.1.1 Quantum Mechanical Many-Electron Problem</h1>

  <p>The material world we experience is fundamentally composed of electrons and nuclei. Most physical, chemical, and condensed matter properties emerge from the behavior of electrons. Even though a few (or many) nuclei are involved, it's the electrons that primarily govern observable behavior.</p>

  <h2>‚öõÔ∏è Electrostatic Interactions and Quantum Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>At the atomic scale, electrons and nuclei interact through Coulomb forces.</li>
    <li>For a nucleus with charge \( Z \) at position \( \vec{R} \), and an electron at \( \vec{r} \), the electrostatic potential energy is:
      \[
        V(\vec{r}) = -\frac{Z}{|\vec{r} - \vec{R}|}
      \]
    </li>
    <li>Two nuclei at positions \( \vec{R} \) and \( \vec{R}' \) repel each other via \( Z^2 / |\vec{R} - \vec{R}'| \).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Electrons cannot be described by classical mechanics due to their microscopic nature. Instead, quantum mechanics is required. This includes treatment of them as indistinguishable fermions obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.</p>

  <p>In lighter elements, valence electrons often move at speeds significantly less than light, allowing us to ignore relativistic corrections.</p>

  <h2>üî¨ The Goal of Theory</h2>
  <p>Theory seeks to derive material properties (molecular structure, chemical reactivity, solid-state behavior) from basic physical principles. In particular, <strong>ground-state properties</strong> are of utmost interest.</p>

  <p>This gives rise to <strong>Density Functional Theory (DFT)</strong> ‚Äî a formalism that reformulates quantum mechanics based on the electron density \( \rho(\vec{r}) \), rather than the many-body wave function \( \Psi(\vec{r}_1, ..., \vec{r}_N) \).</p>

  <h2>üìò What This Text Covers</h2>
  <p>This primer focuses on introducing DFT for non-relativistic Coulomb systems. The reader is expected to have some background in quantum mechanics, particularly in working with one-particle wavefunctions \( \psi(\vec{r}) \).</p>

  <p>The many-body wavefunction \( \Psi(\vec{r}_1, \dots, \vec{r}_N) \) is introduced and replaced by the electron density \( n(\vec{r}) \). All relevant energy terms become functionals of this density.</p>

  <p>The two most widely used approximations to the energy functional are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìä Applications and Approximations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The theory is applied to molecules, solids, surfaces, reactions, ionization energies, etc.</li>
    <li>Accuracy depends heavily on approximations to the exchange‚Äìcorrelation functional.</li>
    <li>The book introduces commonly used approximations and their justifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß† Approach of This Book</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-contained introduction ‚Äî minimal need for external references.</li>
    <li>Atomic units used throughout (\( \hbar = e = m = 1 \)) for simplicity.</li>
    <li>Several example systems are explored (atoms, molecules, solids).</li>
  </ul>
