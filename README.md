# 📘 Density Functional Theory (DFT) Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal documentation and learning repository for **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**. This project serves as a detailed companion to the book _A Primer in Density Functional Theory_, and aims to explain every important concept, equation, and method — from fundamental quantum mechanical principles to advanced DFT techniques — in a clear and structured way.
